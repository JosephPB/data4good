# Data4Good

Encouragingly, more and more people want to get involved in using their data analysis skill for good causes, from building tools for use by humanitarian organisations in natural disasters to helping local communities contact their local representative.

Too often, however, people do not know where to start when researching projects to get invoved in or trying to understand which organisations are doing work in this space. This repository aims to be a place to help direct people to organisations, conferences, academic institutions and competitions etc. that and allow them to better understand this landscape.

This is a working repository and initially it will be dominated by organisations I am familiar with - but please do submit a pull request if you know of anything missing from this list, or contact me on j.p.bullock[at]durham.ac.uk

## Definition

For this repository the definition of Data4Good (D4G) will be the pursuit of non-commercial, societal based work with the aim of bettering human life. I will, however, not attempt to cover many highly specilised fields in detail, such as the great work being carried out in the medical sector, and rather focus on more general, accessible projects. Indeed, it is hoped that much of the data used by the institutions included here be open source.

## Disclaimer

The selection of organisation in this repository will not be exhaustive and the mentioning of an organisation does not equate to endorsement. Adidiotnally, some organisations may technically be misclassified (e.g. non-profit/industry) so if you see a mistake please let me know.
